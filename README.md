### Milestone-6

- In order for this to be a full application, it needs to connect it with a backend that can store all the information about the books that user owns. 
- It needs to create a new Ruby on Rails application, it
will be a simple REST API, which should:
 - 1. To allow the user to obtain a list of books in your library
 - 2. To allow the user to remove a book from your library
 - 3. To allow user to add a book to your library
 - 4.Each book should have a title, author (blank by default), and a Category
 - 5. This React/Redux app should make GET/POST/PUT requests to this Rails API to obtain and save data
 - 6. In order to make things simple for now, it needs to deploy the React app and the Rails app as two separate apps
